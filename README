# LangChain Project

## Description
This repository serves as a part of our Language Modeling Class (LangChain) at XYZ University. It contains various projects related to language models and AI in general. 

## Contents
1. `Project 1: Chatbot` - A simple chatbot built using Python and natural language processing tools like NLTK or Spacy. The bot can answer questions based on a set of predefined responses.
2. `Project 2: Text Summarization` - An implementation of text summarization algorithm, like extractive or abstractive ones. It will provide a brief overview of the input document.
3. `Project 3: Sentiment Analysis` - A project where we analyze the sentiment behind various tweets using Natural Language Processing techniques.
4. `Project 4: Text Generation` - Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), this project will generate original text based on a given prompt or seed text.
5. `Project 5: Information Retrieval System` - Implementing an information retrieval system using TF-IDF, BM25, and Elasticsearch for document ranking.
6. `Project 6: Neural Machine Translation (NMT)` - A NMT model that can translate English sentences to French or any other language of your choice.
7. `Project 7: Text Classification with Deep Learning` - Training a deep learning model to classify text into predefined categories like sports, technology etc. using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
8. `Project 8: Q&A System` - Implementing a system that can answer questions from an FAQ document or any given dataset. It uses techniques of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for this task.
9. `Project 9: Text Generation with Transformer Models (e.g., BERT)` - Using transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, etc., to generate original text based on a given prompt or seed text.
10. `Project 10: Language Modeling` - Implementing different language modeling tasks such as next word prediction, perplexity calculation and other related tasks.
